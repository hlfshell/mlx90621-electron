# mlx90621-electron
Electron app for the MLX90621 + Arduino to create an a DIY thermal camera.

# Why was this made
We were trying to create a method to count people "entering" an outdoor event area where infrared reflectors/people counters wouldn't typically work. The idea was to see humans pass by the changing temperatures and then count that. The idea was ultimately abandoned for other methods, but it was still a fun build.

# So it's a camera?
Sort of - the resolution is just a few pixels, but you can clearly identify edges. You can definitely correlate what you're seeing to what the camera is seeing.

The update rate of the thermal sensor is amazingly quick.

# Example

Here's a tweet of me holding the sensor and the electron app working - we're passing a hot cup of coffee and a glass of ice water across it, and a hand.
